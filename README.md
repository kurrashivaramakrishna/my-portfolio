i've used HTML,CSS,Javascript for front end and for backend used Nodejs + AWS S3 Bucket + JWT authentication for  saving data of registration and loging into account and storing profile images to change dynamically. ive created my portfolio with background of rain and then converts to snow later. And i put a menu option with a downloadable Resume document in the bottom-right side .Up on scrolling we have progress-circle of all my skills with individual percentage of my knownledge. In menu button i kept some of my extra curricular things and qualifications.
