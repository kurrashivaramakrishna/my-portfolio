i've used HTML,CSS,Javascript for front end and for backend used Nodejs and mysql for saving data of registration and loging into account. ive created my portfolio with background of rain and then converts to snow later. And i put a menu option with a downloadable Resume document in the bottom-right side .Up on scrolling we have progress-circle of all my skills with individual percentage of my knownledge. In menu button i kept some of my extra curricular things i do in my daily life.
